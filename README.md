# travel-journal
As an avid traveler, this is the beginnings of a travel journal to catalog some of my favorite destinations over the years.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, JSX

This is the second solo project for Scrimba's React Course.

## Optimizations

In addition to listing the destinations, I plan to:
- add a form to input destinations and storing that data
- add a google map with pins to the destinations on the list


## Lessons Learned:

This project included the utilization of sending props to components, destructuring props, passing in non-string props, conditional rendering, how react renders arrays, mapping components, loading images from .map(), mapping experiences data into components, passing objects as props, spread object as props.
